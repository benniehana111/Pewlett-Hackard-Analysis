# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 

This analysis is based on a human resources dataset for containing data on 300,024 Pewlett Hackard employees, including their name, gender, birth date, hire date, salary, job title, and department. This data was filtered to generate a list of potential retirees (defined as those born in the years 1952-1955). A second filter was developed to identify potential post retirement mentors; (defined as those born in the years 1965) who could serve as mentors to newly hired personnel. 

## Results

1. Over 30% (90,398 employees) of Pewlett Hackard's workforce were identified as potential retirees.

2. Senior engineers makeup one third of the pool of potential retirees. This concentrated loss of senior technical talent may require focused efforts to reconstitute.

3. The distribution of potential retirees was:

  Sr Staff          -  8,047
  Technique Leader  -  4,502
  Staff             - 32,452
  Sr Engineer       - 29,415
  Engineer          - 14,221
  Asst Engineer     -  1,761
 
4. A pool of 1,940 employees were flagged as potential mentors for new employees.

## Summary

The pending "silver tsunami" is real, with the likely loss of nearly 30,000 senior engineers in the near future. The pool of less than 2,000 potential mentors is too small for a potential ingest of over 90,000 new employees.

Two additional queries should be added to this analysis:

1. A count of all unique job titles within the current work force for comparison with the total from #3 above, allowing us to estimate what proportion of each job title Pewlett Hackard may be losing.

2. An expanded analysis for the mentorship program which flags only senior staff and senior engineers, over a much larger range of birth years (e.g., 1952 to 1965) vice only 1965.
3.
